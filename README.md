Introduction

The history of police shootings in the US is painful and characterized by systemic issues and racial disparities. From 2015 – 2020, thousands of Americans died due to police shootings.  These shootings have been under intense scrutiny as citizens are advocating for justice and accountability to put a stop to police brutality. This data collected provides insights into the demographics, circumstances and outcomes of these shootings to shape the ongoing conversation around reforming police practices.
Data Overview
The data was accessed from the US Police Department Records. The data contains the following attributes;
•	Victim ID
•	Name
•	Date
•	Manner of Death
•	Armed (the type of arms the victim possessed)
•	Age
•	Gender
•	Race
•	City
•	State
•	Signs of Mental Illness (True or False, if the victims had any signs of mental illness)
•	Threat Level
•	Flee
•	Body camera (True or False, if the police officer had a body camera on during the incident)
•	Arms Category
•	Arm Status (armed, unarmed or unknown)
Key Statistics
1.	Total Fatalities: 4895 individuals were shot and killed by police from 2015 to 2020.
2.	Annual Fatalities: The yearly breakdown of police shootings shows little variations over the years with a steep decline in 2020.
2015- 965
2016-904
2017-906
2018-888
2019-858
2020-374
The sharp decline in 2020 could be attributed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on police activities, protests and the calls for reforms.
Problems (Questions)
1.	How often do police officers assess accurately if a suspect is a real threat, and if implicit bias based on gender or race influences the perception of danger?
2.	What factors contribute to the higher incidence of police shootings in states such as Texas, California and Florida?
3.	Why is body camera usage inconsistent amongst police officers during critical encounters?
Analysis:
1.	Gender Disparity. 
From the data, it could be seen that a large percentage of victims were males accounting for approximately 95%. This could be influenced by gender-based biases where Males are perceived to be physically stronger and more aggressive, which may heighten perceived threats during encounters with the police. Also, cultural factors may encourage men to resist submission, which can escalate confrontations. However, women accounted for about 5% of fatalities, which suggest they are less likely to be involved in fatal encounters with law enforcement. 
2.	Racial Bias:
Racial disparity has been the main point of contention in public discourse concerning police shootings. White individuals represented the largest proportion of those killed, with Blacks being second, followed by Hispanic. The argument about racial bias and disparity would be confirmed with further analysis factoring in the population of each race during the period. 
3.	Geographical Analysis: 
Geographic analysis shows that police shootings are more frequent in certain states, California had the highest number of incidents with 701 deaths, Texas recording 426 and Florida, 324 deaths. Further investigation is needed to understand the specific factors driving these numbers, such as population, crime rates or policing policies.
4.	Age Distribution:
Most of the individuals shot by the police are young adults and middle-aged between the ages of 18 and 45. The data also shows that fewer victims were children, teenagers and the elderly.
5.	Armed Status: 
The majority of the individuals shot were armed, with guns, knives and other weapons. However, about 6% were unarmed at the time of the shooting, raising concerns about the appropriateness of the use of lethal forces in those cases.
6.	Body Camera Usage:
The data shows body cameras were not used consistently by police officers in the shooting cases. In about 88% of incidents, the police officers involved either did not wear their body cameras or did not have them activated. The lack of footage limits the ability to assess the circumstances surrounding these shootings. This undermines trust in law enforcement. 
Recommendations
1.	Police officers should undergo continuous training to address implicit biases and improve their de-escalation skills. 
2.	Officers should be trained in mental health intervention practices to help handle situations involving individuals experiencing mental health crises.
3.	The use of body cameras should be mandated during all police interactions to provide an unbiased record of events and promote transparency and accountability. Also, police officers who flout the rules should be punished.
4.	There should be policy reforms and increased community engagement on how best to interact with the police to avoid any fatalities. Also, there should be an investment in non-lethal policing tools such as batons, the use plastic bullets, tasers and net guns.
Conclusion
The data from 2015-2020 paints a complex picture of shootings in the US. Further analysis will be needed to ascertain if there are indeed racial disparities and systemic flaws. Though some steps have been taken toward reform, the persistence of these issues calls for a comprehensive change. Addressing these issues with urgency, will restore the trust the people have in the police department.
